Workflow 
1 Assembly and coding prediction
1.1 Trinity assemble

1.2 RSEM compute unigene expression profiles

1.3 Unigenes with numbers of counts more than 50 and with no blanks, were selected for the following analyses

1.4 differential genes edger/deseq
Genes with an FDR threshold ≤ 0.05 and fold change ≥ 2 (absolute value of log2 Fold Change ≥1) 

1.5 Open reading frames (ORFs) were predicted by TransDecoder (http://transdecoder.github.io/) using the Pfam domain search method

2 Functional annotation
2.1 The protein sequences generated by TransDecoder were queried using a BLASTP algorithm-based search (E-value < 1e-5) of
the public proteins databases.
Nr, Swiss-Prot, COG, Conserved Domain Database(CDD):http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/bwrpsb/bwrpsb.cgi , Gene Ontology(GO), KEGG

2.2 The GO annotation and enrichment analysis of DEGs within the aforementioned DEG matrix data were performed using the
Blast2GO program.
